                    <p class="aboutusmessager">Ashley is amazing. When I first met her I knew she was amazing and every passing day reminds me of just how amazing she is! What really blows me away is her incredibly unique blend of talents, interests, and personality. She's a talented artist, always excited about trying new things, and a genuinely loving person. Ashley can be doing anything from leading a design project to playing with her niece and she has the same happy, welcoming demeanor that makes her a joy to be around. In life you interact with a lot of different people, but only once in a lifetime do you find someone who is your perfect match. Ashley is perfect for me. She's everything I've always dreamed of and I'm so excited to spend the rest of my life with her!</p>
